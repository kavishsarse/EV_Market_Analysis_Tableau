# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

An electric vehicle (EV) includes both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), which run solely on electric power, and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), which use a combination of battery power and internal combustion engines.

This dashboard visualizes data from **84,768 vehicles** across the United States, providing insights into EV market trends, brand dominance, and policy eligibility.

---

### üîç Objective of the Project
- To analyze EV market penetration and brand-wise dominance in the U.S.
- To evaluate the average electric range and growth trends of EVs over time.
- To assess Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility and its policy impact.

### üìä Dashboard Overview
- **Total Vehicles:** 84,768  
- **Average Electric Range:** 67.4 miles  
- **Total BEVs:** 65,357 (77.1%)  
- **Total PHEVs:** 19,411 (22.9%)  

---

### üìå Key Insights
- **Tesla leads the market** with over 38,000 vehicles (51.8%), followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.
- **Model Y and Model 3** account for 36.9% of total EVs.
- **California dominates** the adoption with 84,429 vehicles.
- BEVs significantly outnumber PHEVs, reflecting a shift toward fully electric mobility.
- **CAFV Eligibility:** 41.76% of vehicles qualify, while 46% remain uncategorized‚Äîhighlighting a need for clearer labeling and policy outreach.

---

### üìç Visualizations Used
- **Area chart** to show EV growth by model year  
- **Bar charts** for vehicle count by make and model  
- **Geo map** to highlight state-wise EV distribution  
- **Donut chart** for CAFV eligibility segmentation  
- **Dynamic filters** for EV type, make, location, and policy eligibility

---

### üìò How to Use
- Use left-side filters to narrow down vehicle type, location, and eligibility.
- Hover over any state or chart segment to explore exact values and market share.
- Use the Top N slider to dynamically change how many top models or makes are shown.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Focus EV policy efforts in states with emerging but low penetration.
- Encourage automakers with low CAFV eligibility to increase policy-aligned models.
- Explore feedback and incentives to improve the average electric range beyond 67 miles.
